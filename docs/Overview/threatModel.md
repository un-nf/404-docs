## Why *shouldn't* I install and run this on my machine?

If you do not understand JavaScript, or if you don't take the time to look through the code, there is almost no point in you downloading this proxy. The point of this is not to be a privacy proxy. **Not yet.** This repository, in its current state, is built for researchers, developers, and privacy advocates who understand the trade-offs and are comfortable with...

***Manual configuration*** - Profiles require review and occasional tweaking based on your use-case and threat model. If you're confused about configuration, feel free to reach out in an [email](mailto:404mesh@proton.me), open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/un-nf/404/issues), or [submit a ticket](https://discord.gg/G7rUYrZqS2) in the Discord.

***!Occasional! breakage*** - Breakage is honestly limited to having to manually solve a captcha every now and again. Still, some websites will break, some login flows will fail, some features won't work. This is the nature of deep protocol mutation. If there's something critical, open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/un-nf/404/issues) and I will try to find a workaround.

***Active maintenance*** - Browser updates change fingerprinting surfaces. Profiles need updating. You can't just "set it and forget it." I will update as frequently as I can.

***Technical comlexity*** - It's a lot. I know, but honestly it kind of just works right now. It may get you rate-limited or flagged as a bot (I haven't been yet, and I run this jawn every day), but you should be able to pass Captchas and prove you're a human -- no, the pole is not a part of the 'street light.'

> I do not know the long term effects on account usage. I have been logging-in via this proxy using my personal Google, Microsoft, and Apple accounts for the last 9-ish months, and I have experienced *no* retaliation (bans and whatnot). That is *not* to say you will have the same experience. **I *strongly* recommend that you use alternate/disposable accounts if you're going to be testing OAuth or other login flows.**
