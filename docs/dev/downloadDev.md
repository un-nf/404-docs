# Getting Started - Download 404

### Download (easy)

The *simplest* option is to download a zipped version of the repository. *This does not guarantee an up-to-date version of the application*.

[**Download .zip**](../assets/404.zip)

!!! Warning ".zip file last updated: 2/11/2026"

Please be sure to move this .zip file to the location you would like it (e.g. `~/git/`) before unzipping the file. Though moving the repo is a simple enough process at any time, doing so now will save you from losing it in your `Downloads/` folder as well as allow you to use the commands provided more seamlessly.

!!! Tip

    I recommend you create a new directory @ `/Users/[username]/git/`

    You can do this using the following commands...

    **Windows**: `mkdir %USERPROFILE%\git\`

    **Linux/macOS**: `mkdir -p ~/git/`

    **OR** by using the *file explorer*.

    Place the .zip file here and click on it to extract a new directory: `~/git/404` automatically.

### Clone (secure)

The *best* option is to use your command line to download the latest version of the repository from `Github` or `Codeberg`.

**1. Create a folder for 404** *or navigate to your `git` directory.*

Windows:
```
mkdir -p %USERPROFILE%\git\
cd %USERPROFILE%\git\
```

Linux/macOS:
```
mkdir -p ~/git/
cd ~/git/
```

**2. Clone to your local projects/ or git/ directory**

All operating systems: 
```
git clone https://github.com/un-nf/404.git
cd 404
```
