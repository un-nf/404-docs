# Getting Started - Download 404

### Download (easy)

The *simplest* option is to download a zipped version of the repository. *This does not guarantee an up-to-date version of the application*.

[**Download .zip**](assets/404.zip)

!!! Warning

    *.zip file last updated 1/19/2025*

Please be sure to move this .zip file to the location you would like it (e.g. `~/git/404/`) before unzipping the file. Though moving the repo is a simple enough process at any time, doing so now will save you from losing it in your `Downloads/` folder.

!!! Tip

    I recommend you create a new directory @ `/Users/[username]/git/404`

    You can do this using the following commands...

    **Windows**: `mkdir %USERPROFILE%\git\404`

    **Linux/macOS**: `mkdir -p ~/git/404`

### Clone (secure)

The *best* option is to use your command line to download the latest version of the repository from `Github` or `Codeberg`.

**1. Create a folder for 404**

Windows:

`mkdir -p %USERPROFILE%/git/404`

Linux/macOS:

`mkdir -p ~/git/404`

**2. Clone to your local projects/ or git/ directory**

All Operating Systems:

`git clone https://github.com/un-nf/404.git`
